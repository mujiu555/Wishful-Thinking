## Debugging

## Logger

Log, like printf, but with more information.

It is possible to print with colour.

Using ASCII escape codes to draw color.

It is possible to use third party log system.
Most of which may be placed in `/var/log`.
`Journalctl` will place log in `/var/log/journal`

## Debugger

Step debuggers: `GDB`, and so on.

It is possible to walk through the execution

## Static checker

Try to detect errors without actually execute a program.

## Inspect

## Profiling

Count time is useful.

And real time: the time program cost to execute to finish.
User time: the cpu time a program used.
System time: the system cost during the program executes.

## CPU profiling

Tracing: record all information during program executes.
Sampling: regularly inspect program.

Thus tracing will result to performance decrease.

Liner profiler: cost for each line's execute.

## Memory profiling

## Analysis

`Perf`:

- list:
- stat:
- record:
- report:

## Visualize

- Flame Graph
- Call Graph

## Resource profiling
