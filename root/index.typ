= Hello, world!

This is my personal page hosted on github pages, powered by #link("https://github.com/Glomzzz/typsite/")[Typsite].

Which records some of my works and articles.
Derived from my repository #link("https://github.com/mujiu555/Wishful-Thinking")[Wishful-Thinking] manually.
Could someone help me to automate this process? Thanks a lot!
(For example, using GitHub Actions)

=== We are proud of being sick

WE ARE NERD, FREAK, GEEK, OTaku, WEIRDO, LONER, SOCIALLY AWKWARD, ASPERGER, AUTISTIC, ADHD, ETC.

But the reason why is that we have our interests, our passion, our dreams.

The world does not understand us, but we understand ourselves.

We are not afraid of being different.

We are proud of being sick, being special.
Wondering our future, dreaming our future.

We are not the losers, we are doing what we love.

= Works
