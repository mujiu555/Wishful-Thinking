= Hello, world!

This is my personal page hosted on GitHub pages, powered by #link("https://github.com/Glomzzz/typsite/")[Typsite].

Which records some of my works and articles.
Derived from my repository #link("https://github.com/mujiu555/Wishful-Thinking")[Wishful-Thinking] manually.
Could someone help me to automate this process? Thanks a lot!
(For example, using GitHub Actions)

== Self Intro

Here is a brief introduction about myself:

- College student majoring in Information and Computing Science (ICS).
- pre-OIer (but really 菜).
- I learnt many different programming languages, with different design principle:
  - C/C++, Rust, C\#, Common Lisp, Scheme programming.
  - Python hater, but sometimes use it for most of my research works.
  - JavaScript is so awful that I have just used it for a few days, and never want to touch it again unless my work requires.
  - I once give a try to Java and Clojure, a JVM based language, but Java is disappoint me.
    Maven, Gradle leaves me a bad impression, it's hard for me to setup the development environment.
  - Assembly learnt.
  - I swear I am trying my best to learn Haskell/Idris2 for my interests in Programming Language Theory.
  - Wondering wondering, whether should I learn Kotlin or Scala?
  - Clojure is also a language I'm interested in, along with gerbil (r7rs derived), tried but not really good at it.
- Other than regular programming languages, I have some advanced experiences in programming language theory:
  - Stanford CS 107 Programming Paradigm learnt,
  - MIT 6.404 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs WIP,
  - Build your own lisp learnt,
  - Crafting Interpreters WIP,
  - Types and Programming Languages WIP,
- Software is not the only thing I am interested in, I also have some experience in hardware:
  - Embedded programming using c
  - Actually, I have no hardware or electronic courses,
- BTW I use `NixOS`. (Yeah, I was an Arch User)
- Not a femboy! Meow\~
  - It is just a natural look, I swear!
  - Dresses are pretty!
  - Normal passing by weeb.
  - Ignore my strange behaviours, please\~\~\~
- I wish I were a pretty boy.

You can call me anything if you want, since I don't really care about my pronouns, but "he", "she", "they", "MuJiu" or "MeowYou" is preferred.
