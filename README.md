Notes and other thoughts.

## Background

I don't known why I want to post this on the Internet.

But, after all, I did it.

## Install

This is (probably) a plain-text project.

And it can just be seen as a diary.

I don't think it is worth to installing.

## Usage

Most of the notes will be written in markdown.

But some of which may be done with org-mode.

So, it will be nice to have a configured Emacs.

## Related Efforts

Not yet. (Laugh

After all, this is just a diary.
